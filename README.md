# üçç Foodle

I developed a food-themed version of Wordle using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), setting a one-hour time limit for the task. The game is nearly finished, but it still needs a score counter and functionality for managing win/lose states. You can check out the project live at this [demo URL](https://nextjs.org/)

## Local setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
